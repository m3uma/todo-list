# todo-list

Everyone should have a to do list app ;)

## Description

In the todo list app you can add to-do tasks. Mark them as done and delete them. You can mark all tasks as done and hide / show completed tasks. If you want to add a task, enter it in input visible at the top of the application and press the "add task" button. To mark a task as done, click on the green square on the left side of the task. To delete a task, click on the red square on the right side of the task. To show / hide done tasks, use the button in the right corner, and next to it there is a button to mark all tasks as completed.
